  review_1: Le performance di Geek Uninstaller sono impressionanti. Disinstalla velocemente ed elimina i file residui che nessuno trova. , the app is an impressive maintenance tool that delivers on both performance and features. Highly recommended.
  review_2: The bottom line is that Geek Uninstaller is a nice tool that can be quite useful. Inexperienced users shouldn’t have any troubles while working with this program, thanks to its intuitive layout and overall simplicity.
  review_3: Geek Uninstaller is perfect for anyone who wants to make sure they leave nothing behind on their system when they uninstall a program.
  review_4: Geek Uninstaller is both portable and supports almost all the features anyone would expect from an uninstaller tool. Perfect for flash drives because it's a single file that takes up very little space.
  review_5: I've gotten so sick of using several different uninstallers just to be able to manage both my 32 and 64-bit applications. Not only did they not work as well as I would like, most of them were bloated with all kinds of unnecessary features which I did not want. Geek Uninstaller is the perfect uninstaller for me. The UI is simple and perfect, and uninstalls are fast and accurate. I just wish I had found this sooner, as I finally got fed up with the other free 64bit uninstall app and caved and purchased a Revo Pro license just one week ago... I like your program so much that I used it to remove Revo Pro after I installed it, lol.
  review_6: I've used other uninstallers before (i.e. Revo Uninstaller and others), and your product beats them hands-down. It's so easy to use, and I've never had a problem, as I did with Revo, with programs not populating the uninstall list. I install and uninstall software quite regularly, and GeekUninstaller has definitely made my life easier, not to mention my PC much cleaner. Thanks again for the excellent product.
  review_7: I just want to say thank you very much for developing such a wonderful piece of software. I recently have used Revo Uninstaller and IObit Uninstaller, except they weren't so pleasing to use. Revo Uninstaller wouldn't list all my programs and IObit Uninstaller got rid of too much, causing other program conflict. So, in short...I gave up on using uninstallers period, until I downloaded GeekUninstaller. You literally have created something way better than the competition....And I just want to say thank you for that. I have already started recommending your product to friends and family. Good job you have done here, keep up the great work.
  review_8: I've tried a ton of uninstallers over the years. Geek Uninstaller is, hands down, the finest uninstaller I've ever seen. Simple, extremely effective, easy and gets the job done. Congrats.
